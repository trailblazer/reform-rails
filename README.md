_Rails-support for Reform_.

Loads Rails-specific Reform files and includes modules like `Reform::Form::ActiveModel` automatically.

Simply don't include this gem if you don't want to use the conventional Reform/Rails stack. For example in a Hanami environment or when using dry-validations, refrain from using this gem.
